# Cell-Sheet-Tracking-Matlab-GUI

* Designed a GUI for Cell-Sheet-Tracking algorithm which tracks the shape of epithelial cells as they move through space and time in an image sequence.
* The GUI automatically generates ground truth of the input picture and the corresponding B-spline model. It allows users to edit the B-splines by drawing on the edge and endpoints of a spline.
* Designed algorithms in Matlab and Java to simplify the editing process of CST, a system that tracks epithelial cells movement.
* The algorithms generate the mathematical model of edge(spline) and automatically fit the edge to the shape of bright pixels
representing a curve in an noisy background image.
* The system assists CST to automatically correct its model for ground truth and thus save huge amount of human labor.
